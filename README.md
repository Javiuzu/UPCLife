Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.

## Installation

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

```bash
pip install dark_side
```

## Usage

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

## Contributing

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

## License

Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
