# UPCLife
This project was made during HackUPC2021.

This app allows clubs and associations to publish information that can be useful to the students, such as location, how to join, which clubs they have already joined and need to pay membership for, and announce upcoming events. Students can keep track of events happening on campus as well as create groups (for example, study groups) which can also have events of their own. The app also provides a section to look for lab partners and study buddies for the courses the student is signed up to.
